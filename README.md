# Bluemix Starter App w/ React + Webpack

This is boilerplate built off of Bluemix's standard NodeJS and Express starter app. It includes React and Webpack.

## Usage

The app is good to go to be uploaded into a standard Cloud Foundry SDK for Node.JS instance.

* Webpack: `npm run build` to build webpack bundle
* Local server: `npm start` to run server. NOTE: I believe this script is required to work correctly with Cloud Foundry, so be careful when modifying it.
